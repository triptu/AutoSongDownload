'''What it does-
"Download song of your choice in audio format in two steps by just entering the name."

Usage - 4 ways:-
1. Run the program and enter the song name.
2. From cmd line or run enter "song <song name>". This is will give you top
    n results(n depends on you).
3. From cmd line or run enter "song /<song name>". First result will be automatically downloaded.
   Add '/' ultimately(or penultimately if you are using next option to not run after downloading.)
4. Add 1 at last to download both video and audio.
   and 0 at last to download only video.
   Don't add anything for only audio.
5. You can just copy the song name and run "song" command from cmd or run. No
need to paste just copy. Note:-This will automatically download the first result by default. (You
can change that too.)
6. You can create a keyboard shorcut to shorten the 4th way even more. Just copy the
    the song name and press that Keyboard shortcut. And the download will start.
